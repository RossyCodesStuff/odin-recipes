    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>
      While it might sound blasphemous to pasta connoisseurs to add sugar and
      ketchup to a pasta sauce, it’s a beloved dish in the Philippines. Thanks
      to American colonization in the Philippines in the late 1800s, Filipinos
      were introduced to a myriad of American products, like hot dogs and
      ketchup. There’s a rumor that Filipino spaghetti was created due to the
      influence of General Douglas MacArthur during World War II. In Japan,
      MacArthur ate Spaghetti Neapolitan, which has ketchup as an ingredient.
