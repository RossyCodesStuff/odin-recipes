    <p>
      This chicken adobo, “adobong manok,” recipe will give you bright, peppery,
      and savory tender chicken that feels like a warm hug–it gets even better
      when you mix the adobo “sabaw,” or soup, with fresh steamed rice. It’s a
      classic Filipino comfort food that is easy to make at home for any day of
      the week. It’s no wonder it’s one of the Philippines’ most famous dishes
      just like chicken inasal, chicken tinola, and pork bbq skewers!
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h1>Background</h1>
    <p>
      Not to be mistaken with <em>Spanish</em> style adobo that uses paprika and
      oregano, this Filipino version is something completely different.
      <strong>Filipino</strong> adobo is indigenous to the Philippines and each
      region has its own version, like pork adobo, fish adobo, shrimp adobo, and
      more. Adobo is basically a cooking process and dish that can include meats
      and vegetables that are marinated and cooked in a blend of vinegar, soy
      sauce, pepper, and garlic. Many regions add different ingredients too,
      like coconut milk or even turmeric. Chicken adobo is extremely similar to
      Vietnamese braised pork thịt kho, but with vinegar and a more peppery
      kick. When Spanish colonizers saw this cooking method, they noticed how
      Filipinos used vinegar to marinate meat, which was similar to the Spanish
      term for marinating or pickling, “adobar.” They named it “adobar de los
      naturales” or adobo of the natives. The inclusion of soy sauce was
      influenced by Chinese migrants later on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filipino adobo often tastes sour, salty, and a little sweet compared to
      Spanish adobo, which can be spicier and offers a different flavor profile
      based on the herbs and spices used like paprika. Chicken adobo is probably
      one of the most popular and well known versions of adobo. For this recipe,
      I like to stay with the traditional, simple ingredients that give some of
      the most flavorful, tender pieces of chicken.

    <h2>The vinegar</h2>
    <p>
      Vinegar is one of the most important ingredients for this recipe and I
      would really recommend going to your local Filipino or Asian grocery store
      to buy cane sugar vinegar, like Datu Puti Sukang Maasim. Cane sugar
      vinegar differs from white distilled vinegar because it’s slightly less
      acidic and more mellow, whereas white distilled vinegar has a sharp and
      super pungent flavor profile. While you can use white distilled vinegar in
      chicken adobo, the pungent flavor might come out too strong and you will
      need to adjust the amount used in a recipe. If you can’t find cane sugar
      vinegar nearby, you can also substitute with white wine vinegar instead
      because it has a similar acidity and flavor profile.
    </p>
    <h2>Chicken and marinade</h2>
    <p>
      I like to eat party wings and drumsticks for this recipe because I love
      eating bone-in chicken pieces (better flavor and fattier). These pieces
      also cook faster when braising in a stew. You can also use other pieces of
      chicken like thighs, my girlfriend’s mom chops up a whole chicken into
      smaller pieces–no waste there! Depending on the thickness of different
      pieces, you may need to adjust the cooking time–just check for tenderness
      and internal temperature while braising. Marinating the chicken is
      probably one of the most important parts of the adobo process because it
      helps to flavor and tenderize the meat. While I’ve seen recipes tout a 30
      minute marinating process, I’ve marinated many chicken recipes (chicken
      karaage, Korean fried chicken, and cà ri gà) to know that the longer you
      marinate chicken, the better the flavor. For this recipe, I marinate the
      chicken for at least 3 hours to get a good amount of flavor, however, I
      would marinate overnight if I had enough time.

    <h2>Cooking tips</h2>
    <p>Here are some tips for cooking chicken adobo:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Marinate the chicken for at least 3 hours. The longer you marinate the
        chicken, the better the flavor will be once it’s cooked.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep the marinating liquid to use for braising, but also add enough
        water to your pot so that it’s slightly above chicken and it can braise
        properly. You want to watch the pot to stir occasionally, taste test,
        and add more water if necessary. Be careful when stirring so as to not
        break the chicken meat from falling off the bone.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you find that your adobo tastes too vinegary and still needs to cook,
        add one teaspoon of brown sugar to adjust and then taste again. Repeat
        if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        It’s difficult to fix an oversalted stew, so start off by underseasoning
        and know that your liquid will reduce. You can add water to dilute it,
        but know this fix will make the stew more liquidy than may be intended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Like many Filipino recipes, chicken adobo is best served with hot,
        steaming rice. The strong flavor of chicken adobo pairs so well with the
        light flavor of rice.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      One of my favorite things about chicken adobo is that it gets better the
      day after! The flavors infuse the chicken overnight and it tastes even
      better.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>

    <h2>Marinade</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 lb chicken wings and drumsticks</li>
      <li>3 tbsp cane sugar vinegar Datu Puti brand preferably</li>
      <li>¼ c soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tbsp garlic (about 10 cloves) minced</li>
      <li>2 bay leaves</li>
      <li>½ tsp peppercorns</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 tsp dark brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 ¾ c water</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Instructions</h1>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Marinade</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Prep your chicken. If you have wings, make sure to separate the pieces
        between the flat and the drumstick to make for easier cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a mixing bowl, combine the vinegar, soy sauce, minced garlic, bay
        leaf, and peppercorns. Add the chicken and mix so that each piece is
        covered with the marinade. Transfer chicken and marinade sauce into an
        airtight container and place it in the fridge for at least 3 hours. The
        longer you marinade, the better the flavor is infused into the chicken.
        The best chicken adobo I’ve had was marinated overnight.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Move the chicken from the fridge to the counter about 20-30 minutes
        before cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a pot over medium heat and add the vegetable oil. Brown the chicken
        for about one minute on each side or until the skin turns a light brown.
        If you can’t brown the chicken at the same time, you can do this in
        batches and transfer the browned pieces on a plate and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        After browning the pieces, place all the chicken into the pot and add
        the leftover marinating liquid (don’t forget the bay leaf).
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the water and dark brown sugar into the pot and stir. The water
        level should be right where the top of the chicken reaches, but not
        above the chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Raise the heat to medium-high (320 °F) and bring the liquid to a boil
        for about ten seconds and then lower the heat medium-low (260 °F) so
        that it simmers. Cover with the lid and simmer for 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the lid, stir the contents, and bring the heat up back to medium
        (300 °F) heat uncovered to reduce the liquid for another 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Check the temperature of the chicken to make sure it reaches 160 °F.
        Taste test and adjust the soup based on your preference, it should be
        very savory, tangy, and have enough saltiness. Remember this is meant to
        be eaten with rice to balance it out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tips: If your chicken adobo is too salty, add one tablespoon of water to
        dilute at a time and taste again. If your chicken adobo is too tangy or
        has too much vinegar flavor for your liking, try adding one teaspoon of
        dark brown sugar and taste again.
      </li>
      <li>Serve immediately with rice.</li>
    </ol>
